# TICTACTOEGAME
Overview
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game, a simple desktop app made with Java's AWT. This game lets two players take turns clicking on a grid to place their X or O. Once the game ends, you can start a new game with one click.

Features
3x3 Tic Tac Toe Grid: The game shows a 3x3 grid. Each cell is a button you can click to place your X or O.
Player Turns: The game knows whose turn it is and puts the correct X or O in the cell when clicked.
Check Winner: After each turn, the game checks if someone has won. If there is a winner, it shows a message and resets the grid for a new game.
